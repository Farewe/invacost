virtualspecies v0.3-1 (Release date: unreleased yet)
==============

Fixed a bug in costTrendOverTime when incomplete.years.weight was set to NULL

* General improvements for calculrateRawCosts:
  - added annual costs in the output
  - improved handling of the last year with a new argument

virtualspecies v0.3 (Release date: unreleased yet)
==============

* Major changes to the models in costTrendOverTime(): 
  - added robust regression models (thanks Andrew Kramer!)
  - changed error estimations for ordinary least square regressions in order
  to account for heteroscedasticity and temporal autocorrelation
  - changed GAM model family to use Gaussian Location-Scale family, in order
  to account for heteroscedasticity
  - added the summary of models directly in the output of costTrendOverTime()
* Added precisions about the error bands for MARS models in the help file

virtualspecies v0.2-4 (Release date: unreleased yet)
==============

Changes:

* Changed the method used to manually specify graphical parameters


virtualspecies v0.2-3 (Release date: unreleased yet)
==============

Changes:

* Added the number of estimates and the number of "year values" (total
number of individual values spread over all years in raw costs

virtualspecies v0.2-2 (Release date: unreleased yet)
==============

Changes:

* Major change in how objects are plotted. Now, basic functions will not make
any plot, and all plots will be called with plot(object). 
* Greatly improved plotting of invacost objects, included new possibilities and
arguments:
  - choice between bars or points, average or total costs for raw costs
  - choice of a single or multiple facets for cost trends over time

virtualspecies v0.2-1 (Release date: unreleased yet)
==============

Changes:

* Fixed an issue with calculateRawAvgCosts: previously the average per period
was calculated on the basis of effective years (i.e., empty years were excluded
from the average). Now, the average will always be based on the entire period.
There is no reason to believe that incomplete year are only those for which
we have no data at all, so we should not make any tentative correction based on
so-called "effective years" here. Furthermore, it implied comparing different
time intervals (e.g., 1 year vs. 10 years), which is generally inadequate. From
now on, the function will make a raw average per period of time regardless of
data completion.


virtualspecies v0.2 (Release date: unreleased yet)
==============

Changes:

* Added the calculateRawAvgCosts function


virtualspecies v0.1 (Release date: unreleased yet)
==============

Changes:

* First version of the package
